**Xamarin - Part 1**
======
 This sample corresponsds to the very first episode of Quick Dev, where we dive into Xamarin, a toold used to build cross platform mobile applications by sharing code and using C#.  This is amazing because a developer no longer has to know 3 different languages, IDEs, etc. to be able to target Android, IOS, and Windows.  Xamarin is a paid product, but free for students.  It can be used on Windows using Visual Studio or in Xamarin Studio on Mac or Windows.

This first sample represents a Hello World intro to Xamarin.Forms which allows UI code to be shared.  This sample uses C# to create the UI instead of XAML, but nonetheless, all of the code in this sample is 100% shared.

## **How to Use**

Clone the Quick Dev samples with the following command.

```$ git clone https://github.com/jamesqquick/QuickDev.git ```

Then, open up Xamarin-Part1->Xamarin-Part1.sln in either Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio to run the sample.
